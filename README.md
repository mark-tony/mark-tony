- 👋 Hi, I’m @mark-tony, a Computer Engineering student at Boston University graduating on May 16, 2021.
- 👀 I’m interested in solving the world's seemingly infinite problems with the definitely finite list of commands Computer Science has to offer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to change the world for the best most effectively.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FitStart and FootInTheDoor, LLC. Both coming to the Apple App Store soon!
- 📫 How to reach me - marktony@bu.edu for oppurtunities!
